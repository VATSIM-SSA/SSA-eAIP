# Delivery

!!! info
    "Airport Name" does not have a dedicated Delivery frequency, as such all Delivery responsibilities are assumed by "Next ATS Callsign" ("ICAO"_GND). Under no circumstances should a "ICAO"_DEL position ever be opened without prior approval from staff.   **Only include if there is no dedicated Delivery frequency**
    
## Route Validation

!!! warning
    All flights departing out of "ICAO" must have their route checked and be in compliance with the latest Route Matrix. The Route Matrix below has been provided for easy cross checking of flights. **Use either local matrix or Simbrief to find the routes - Remove this line**
