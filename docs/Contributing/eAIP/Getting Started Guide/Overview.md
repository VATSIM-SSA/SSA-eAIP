We are absolutely delighted to have you contributing; however, before you get started, there are a couple of important things for you to learn. This quick start guide will give you the basic tools needed to start contributing to our eAIP. 

Furthermore, should you have any remaining questions, we strongly encourage you to ask in the VATSSA Community Discord server; a link can be found [here](https://community.vatsim.net/).
