# GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is another way of coding for GitHub. It can make the whole process a lot easier. It mainly allows quick and easy organisation of the eAIP through Visual Studio Code. 


## Setup

- GitHub Desktop can be downloaded from [here](https://desktop.github.com/download/).

- Once installed, you can go through the sign-in phase.

- Now we can "Clone the repository".

- By doing this we create a link from our GitHub Web repository to our desktop version. Now that they are linked, we can start coding through VS Code. 

- If you choose to make edits through GitHub Desktop you will need Visual Studio Code installed. You can find the relevant info [here](https://eaip2.vatssa.com/Contributing/eAIP/GitHub-Resources/).

!!! warning
    You will have to keep your desktop version up to date by clicking the "Fetch origin" button.
