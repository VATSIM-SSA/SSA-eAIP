# Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a small, lightweight code editor. 

It is particularly useful when using GitHub Desktop. 

Due to their simple integrations, we only need to follow the shortcut from GitHub Desktop to VS Code. 

Now we can start coding as if we were in the web version with a few slight advantages. 

It is purely personal preference as to whether you use GitHub Web or GitHub Desktop in conjunction with Visual Studio Code.
