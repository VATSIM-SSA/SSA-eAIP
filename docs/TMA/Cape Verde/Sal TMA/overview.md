# Approach/TMA
The 'Sal' TMA convers the airspace surounding the Sal island chain from SFC-FL245, the airspace as such is
- SFC - FL195 - (Class C)
- FL195 - FL245 - (Class A)

!!! Note "Definition of airspace"
    Area delimited by three arcs of
    circle of 80 NM radius centred on
    VOR / DME CVS (164412.03N
    0225703.67W), VOR / DME SNT
    (145620.74N 0232855.64W) and
    NDB SVT (164944.96N
    0250352.65W) and the external
    tangents joining these arcs.

# GVSV_TWR

Whilst "GVSC_APP" Covers the Approach positions for GVAC, GVBA and GVNP, GVSV is slightly different,

GVSV_TWR acts as the final approach position for GVSV and as such they should be simulated this way on VATSIM, the control up to FL105 and control an airspace of 25NM centres around the ARP

whilst they act at APP they should still have the ATS callsign of "San Vincente Tower" on the same frequency of 118.400 MHz and The controller maning the station should not extend their range past 50 NM's allowed by VATSIM [^1] [^2]
