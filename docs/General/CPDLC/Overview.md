# Overview

VATSSA encourages controllers to use CPDLC wherever possible (see https://www.hoppie.nl/acars/). For suitably equipped airports, this includes Pre-Departure Clearances (PDC), and the CPDLC log on will be the airport ICAO code. It is expected of controllers to put their CPDLC logon code into their controller remarks if they are using it.

For enroute CPDLC use, this is offered over much of VATSSA, the logon codes can be found here [CPDLC Logon Codes](https://eaip2.vatssa.com/General/CPDLC/logon-codes/).

CPDLC helps reduce frequency congestion and overall controller workload, therefore Pilots are encouraged to utilise it. 

!!! warning
    Pilots are to familiarise themselves with the controller info prior to logging in. This can be checked here [Vatsim-Radar](https://vatsim-radar.com/).
