## Warnings

| Shortcut | Message | Remarks |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| .fpl | I have not received a flight plan for your callsign. Please ensure that you have filed with the callsign you are connected with, and you have the correct ICAO codes for your departure and arrival airports. If this does not work, try reconnecting. VATSIM CoC B10 refers. | - |
| .nofp | I have not received a flight plan for your callsign. Please ensure that you have filed with the callsign you are connected with, and you have the correct ICAO codes for your departure and arrival airports. If this does not work, try reconnecting. VATSIM CoC B10 refers. | - |
| .nofpl | I have not received a flight plan for your callsign. Please ensure that you have filed with the callsign you are connected with, and you have the correct ICAO codes for your departure and arrival airports. If this does not work, try reconnecting. VATSIM CoC B10 refers. | - |
| .rte | The route you have filed is invalid. Please refile a new flight plan with valid route. I recommend using http://simbrief.com. | - |
| .paused | The VATSIM CoC (B2) states that A pilot shall not pause while connected to the VATSIM Network except when operating under air traffic control. Please unpause immediately or disconnect from the network. | - |
| .mic | .msg $aircraft You have an open mic, please check your push-to-talk keybind. | - |
| .mayday | The VATSIM CoC (B6) states that air traffic control requests the pilot to terminate the emergency, then the pilot shall do so IMMEDIATELY or disconnect from the network. | - |
| .runway | The VATSIM CoC (B1) states that a pilot shall not connect to the VATSIM network on a runway. Please disconnect immediately and re-connect at an open stand. | - |
| .helpvacate | You have not properly vacated the runway. After landing, you have to continue taxiing off the runway and past the hold short line until your whole aircraft is clear. If you stop before this point, you are considered still on the runway and can cause significant delays and issues for ATC and other pilots. If you are unable to follow further instructions, a supervisor will be called. | - |
| .helphs | You have not correctly followed a hold short instruction. When instructed to hold short, you are required to hold before that position ensuring that there is enough space for other aircraft to pass on that taxiway. Taxiing beyond your clearance limit can cause significant delays and issues for ATC and pilots. If you are unable to follow further instructions, a supervisor will be called. | - |
| .warn | As per VATSIM CoC (B8(c)), pilots are expected to promptly comply with basic air traffic control instructions that are applicable to their flight rules. This includes instructions such as holding; flying a speed, heading or flight level; approach to land; correctly fly a cleared routing; fly a holding pattern. It appears that you are unable to comply with these instructions. If you do not comply with further instructions a supervisor will be called. | - |
| .textpilot | As per VATSIM CoC (A14(a)), pilots should be able to at a minimum receive voice, but may send messages via text. If you are unable to comply you MUST disconnect from the network otherwise a supervisor will be called. | - |
| .helpcat2 | You have not correctly held at the CAT2 holding point. | - |
| .noob | It appears that you might be unfamiliar with the correct operation of your aircraft. To ensure a smooth experience for yourself and others on the VATSIM network, we recommend taking some time to practice offline and gain proficiency. This will help you become more confident in handling your aircraft. Alternatively, consider flying an aircraft you are more comfortable and experienced with until you build your skills further. | - |
