## Delivery

* HKUK doesn't have a dedicated Delivery Position, with Diani Tower (HKUK_TWR) assuming the role of Delivery.

#### Flight Level Restrictions

** All restrictions to be reviewed and inserted.**

#### IFR Clearance Rules
IFR departure clearances are not provided, since Diani Airport does not have support for any IFR procedures.  
However, enroute IFR clearances can be coordinated with Mombasa Radar.


### = VFR Clearance Rules
Diani Airport grants all VFR clearances on the tower frequency.

**Phraseology**
VFR aircraft clearance must come from the tower controller, but the ground controller should get some information from the pilot and taxi them out to a runway before they receive their clearance. 
 
When a VFR aircraft calls for clearance, they must include the following: 
- Souls on board 
- Fuel on board 
- Intentions 
 
If the aircraft does not include any of the above, the information must be requested before a clearance is given. 
 
Once all the information has been received from the pilot, the controller must then issue start clearance and taxi instructions to a runway holding point. Once the aircraft is at the holding point, they can receive their clearance. 
 
At this point the aircraft must be handed to tower so that the tower controller can provide the aircraft with a clearance.

### Cruise Level Rules
* Kenyan Airspace operates with the following RVSM standard table of Cruising Levels.

#### SID Selection
As there are no IFR operations at Diani, no SIDs are avialable, check the VFR departure procedures below

#### VFR Markers
* TIWI marker - A school, Bongwe Primary to the north east of Mwakola Dam approximately 4NM to the airport.(Wide right base RWY19)
* PENGO marker - A school, Mwamanga Primary school, approximately 7nm to the south east of Kinango town /7.9NM to the south west of Kwale town

#### Departure Procedures & Initial Climbs

VFR departures are available at Diani 

** VFR Departure Runway 01**
Climb straight ahead, passing 400ft, make a climbing LEFT turn to the TIWI marker and maintain 2000ft.

** VFR Departure Runway 19**
Climb straight ahead, passing 500ft, make a climbing RIGHT turn to the TIWI marker and maintain 2000ft.

Departure can further be coordinated by Mombasa Radar or can be continued on the VFR access lane by a climb to FL28.

** VFR Access Lane**
Diani has one acess lane for a northwesterly departure, following this route for departures:

When HKR11 active:
* TIWI marker
* PENGO marker
* turn right or left or get authorization from Mombasa Radar to avoid airspace infringement
* VFR to IFR clearances can also be obtained from Mombasa Radar

When HKR11 not active:
* TIWI marker
* PENGO marker
* LANZE marker (optional)
* VFR to IFR clearances can also be obtained from Mombasa Radar

**NOTE: Diani Tower controls access lane**

Minimum reccommended altitude for access lane is FL28




## Ground



#### Push-back Procedures

### Phraseology

```

CALLSIGN, push-back approved, facing DIRECTION.

```

| Apron | Type | Facing | Remarks |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Terminal | Main Terminal | North | Only start-up will be needed in most cases, but pushback can be arranged if aircraft turn radius deems it neccessary |  |
| Apron | GA | South-East | North | Only start-up will be needed in most cases, but pushback can be arranged if aircraft turn radius deems it neccessary |


### Terminal Stand Allocation
* There are no stands, so it is purely based on Apron space
* The terminal apron is used for airline arrivals and departures. Hovewer, it can also be used by GA

### Apron Stand Allocation
* There are no stands, so it is purely based on Apron space
* The apron is used for airline arrivals and departures. Hovewer, it can also be used by GA

## Approach


#### VFR Markers
* TIWI marker - A school, Bongwe Primary to the north east of Mwakola Dam approximately 4NM to the airport.(Wide right base RWY19) (coordinates 04°1647.030S 0393249.770E)
* PENGO marker - A school, Mwamanga Primary school, approximately 7nm to the south east of Kinango town /7.9NM to the south west of Kwale town (coordinates 041401.220S 0392308.740E)

#### Arrivals Procedures

**IFR arrivals in IMC**
- RADAR is required
- MDA is 500ft without visual reference

Procedure 1:  
Proceed direct HKUK, descending FL40 or as advised by ATC and report Diani Airport in sight or in VMC

Procedure 2:  
Proceed direct HKUK, descend 2600ft and report VMC or when visually breaking of the clouds then enter wide right base for Runway 19 or straight-in final for Runway 19. 
In the case no visual contact has been established, make a climbing LEFT turn direct MOV VOR FL30 and hold or as further instructed by ATC or contact Mombasa Radar.

**IFR arrivals in VMC**
- RADAR is required

Procedure 1:
Proceed direct HKUK, descend 2600ft until reporting VMC and handed off to Diani Tower from Mombasa Radar. 
Proceed to wide right base for Runway 19

Procedure 2:
Proceed direct HKUK, descend 2600ft until reporting Diani Airport in sight. 
When Diani Airport is in sight, at 4NM for the airport, descend 2400ft at a rate of -300ft/min to avoid terrain. 
Further descent to 1500ft or applicable pattern altitude will be sequenced by Diani Tower.

NOTE: Descending below 500ft without any visual reference is prohibited and requires an immediate missed approach with a climbing LEFT turn to the MOV VOR, holding as published at FL30.

**VFR Arrivals**
VFR access lane:
Proceed directly towards, PENGO maintaining FL30 and intercept the access lane towards TIWI and enter the traffic pattern for the runway in use.

## Coordination


#### HKUK & HKMO
* HKUK & HKMO share the TMA
* HKMO Approach is to release aircraft to HKUK Tower for sequencing onto straight-in or patterns

#### HKJK & HKNW
* HKJK Controllers, particularly Tower and Approach, should be mindful of simultaneous operations at HKJK and [HKNW](HKNW). In most circumstances, most aircraft taking off from HKNW will be taking off to the south, which can cause a conflict for inbound traffic landing on 06. 
* In the event of HKNW traffic, releases from HKJK should be coordinated with Approach, if online, however in most circumstances, HKJK traffic will be given priority.
