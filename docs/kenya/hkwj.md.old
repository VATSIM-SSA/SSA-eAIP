## Delivery

* HKWJ doesn't have a dedicated Delivery Position, with Wajir Ground (HKWJ_GND) assuming the role of Delivery.

#### Flight Level Restrictions

#### IFR Clearance Rules

**Phraseology**
* [callsign], cleared to [destination], [SID] departure via the [transition] transition, climb initially [FL], squawk [squawk].
* [callsign], cleared to [destination], [SID] departure, climb initially [FL], squawk [squawk].
* [callsign], cleared to [destination], via the [airway name] airway, passing FL100, proceed direct [first waypoint] then as filed, climb initially [FL], squawk [squawk]

If a flight has no SID, the flight is to be given the "passing FL100, proceed direct to waypoint".

i.e.

KQA257, cleared to Wajir, passing FL100, proceed direct TEVIN, climb FL110, squawk 5334.

### = VFR Clearance Rules

VFR aircraft clearance must come from the tower controller, but the ground controller should get some information from the pilot and taxi them out to a runway before they receive their clearance. 
 
When a VFR aircraft calls for clearance, they must include the following: 
- Souls on board 
- Fuel on board 
- Intentions 
 
If the aircraft does not include any of the above, the information must be requested before a clearance is given. 
 
Once all the information has been received from the pilot, the controller must then issue start clearance and taxi instructions to a runway holding point. Once the aircraft is at the holding point, they can receive their clearance. 
 
At this point the aircraft must be handed to tower so that the tower controller can provide the aircraft with a clearance. 

### Cruise Level Rules
* Kenyan Airspace operates with the following RVSM standard table of Cruising Levels.

## Coordination


#### HKJK & HKNW
* HKJK Controllers, particularly Tower and Approach, should be mindful of simultaneous operations at HKJK and [HKNW](hknw.md). In most circumstances, most aircraft taking off from HKNW will be taking off to the south, which can cause a conflict for inbound traffic landing on 06. 
* In the event of HKNW traffic, releases from HKJK should be coordinated with Approach, if online, however in most circumstances, HKJK traffic will be given priority.

## Briefing


!!! note ""
Pilots taking part in events that depart from or arrive to HKWJ should make themselves familiar with this briefing page as well as with all existing charts.
##### HKWJ Pilot Briefing

*Pilots taking part in events that depart from or arrive to HKWJ should make themselves familiar with this briefing page as well as with all existing charts.*

### General Notes
* Runway 06 is our preferred departing and arrival runway, up to a tailwind component of 10-15 knots.
* A one-way system operates throughout Apron 1, listed below:
* **06: Taxi out via J or K. Taxi in via M or H**
* **24: Taxi out via M or H, taxi in via J or K**

##### Departure Briefing
* Nairobi has 5 terminals, Terminals: 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D and 2. If you want to know which Terminal (and stand) to spawn at for your specific airline, please refer to the Ground page: [Ground](https://eaip.vatssa.com/hkjk-ground)
* If you don't know which stand to use, our best recommendation is to spawn on a "J" stand.
* We ask any planes operating as Freighters use Apron 2 "F" stands.
* **If for any reason, there is a lack of room on these stands, we ask pilots use Apron 3, however this is unlikely to occur.**
* On initial contact to Nairobi Apron (HKJK_GND), pilots are to report callsign and stand number.
* **Please note, there are many different SIDs, some which lead to the same place. We only use some of these SIDs however. For your own planning reference, please refer to our Delivery Page for what SID to expect. This will also include your initial climbs (at the very bottom). [Delivery Page](https://eaip.vatssa.com/hkjk-delivery)**
* **Initial Climb is not assigned on a per SID basis. This will depend on your direction and type of flight. You can also find what initial climb to expect at the very bottom of the Delivery Page.**
* **During clearance, please make sure to readback your SID and transition (if applicable), initial climb and the squawk.**
* Once you have clearance, wait until 10-15 minutes before your CTOT, before calling for push and start.

### Pushback and Taxi
* Expect a few minutes delay with push during busy times, as there will be planes moving in all directions across the apron, so do be patient when asking for push.
* **Pilots should only ask for push once the pushback tug is fully connected to avoid delays.**
* Once ready for taxi, pilots should expect to be routed out via the standard Apron exits depending on the Runway configuration (see General Notes). Comply with any hold short instructions and do not proceed further until given further taxi by Apron or Tower.
* **On Taxiway G, there are two taxi lines which act as a shortcut onto K for Runway 06. We ask pilots don't use this, unless otherwise instructed to by ATC. If you think you will have a problem with turning from G to K on the normal taxiway, please do ask Tower first before taking the shortcut, so you can be reasonably sequenced in.**

### Takeoff & Departure
* Pilots are expected to be fully configured and ready for departure before reaching the holding point for Runway 06. If you aren't ready, please do advise ATC at the earliest.
* When given take off clearance, pilots should spend as little time on the runway as is needed.
* Once in the air, pilots will be handed to Nairobi Radar (122.300) or Nairobi Control (121.300) for departure. On departure, comply with all SID restrictions, and do not climb further until instructed.
* **If Radar issues the words "climb now", all SID restrictions may be disregarded. Otherwise, all climb instructions must be treated with regard to the SID restrictions.**

##### Arrival Briefing
### Arrivals and Approaches
* As your flight is approaching HKJK, please make yourself familiar with the arrival and approach procedures for Nairobi.
* When Runway 06 is in use, all pilots are to expect the ILS. Otherwise, if Runway 24 is in use, all pilots are to expect an RNP approach.
* On initial contact with Nairobi or Dar-es-Salaam, you will be told the landing runway and the arrival.
* **Please note, most STARs have two sets of arrivals.**
* **For 06, these are known as the "Alpha", e.g. NAKAT4A, or the "Papa", e.g. NAKAT2P. For planning purposes, all pilots are expected to program in a "Papa" arrival where applicable, with a JOMOK ILS transition (chart 11-3 on Navigraph), unless otherwise instructed by ATC. The "Alpha" arrivals may be used for sequencing or during busier times. Listen out to what ATC gives you!**
* **For 24, these are either the "Romeo", e.g. KIMET1R, or the "Delta", e.g. KIMET2D, or the "Charlie", e.g. EVOGO2C. For planning purposes, all pilots are expected to program in the "Romeo" arrival where applicable, with the correct RNP transition, unless otherwise instructed by ATC.**
* Due to the high volume of traffic expected, and Nairobi being a single runway airport, pilots should expect to hold. For more information regarding published holds, please refer to here: [Nairobi Holdings (Approach Page)](https://eaip.vatssa.com/hkjk-approach)
* **When close to the ILS 06, pilots will be cleared via the specific JOMOK2x transition. At this point, descend to the platform altitude (via the transition, 7100ft) to establish. However, please note ATC may deviate from the transition via radar vectors, so comply with the vectors and descent altitudes at all times!**
* During a go around, TWR will issue pilots the instruction on what to do, either "follow missed approach procedure", or "maintain runway heading". Listen out carefully!

### Landing
* When landings, pilots are advised to vacate as quickly as possible to allow for smooth operation. For 06, if a medium aircraft, plan to vacate via E or L. If a heavy aircraft, plan to vacate via L.
* If a pilot vacates via L, continue taxi via G and await further instructions.
* If a pilot vacates via any other taxiway, hold short of G and await further instructions.
* Pilots will be given taxi by Tower to the start of the Apron, before being handed off to Apron for stand.
