# Ground
Victoria Seychelles International does not have a dedicated Ground frequency, as such all Ground responsibilities are assumed by Seychelles Tower (FSIA_TWR). Under no circumstances should FSIA_GND ever be opened without prior approval from staff.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.

On initial call with SMC, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* Persons on Board

* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the SMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active, and if operating on a FPL, a discrete squawk code.
