# Delivery

!!! info
    Brazzaville does not have a dedicated Delivery frequency, as such all Delivery responsibilities are assumed by Brazzavilla Tower (FCBB_TWR). Under no circumstances should a FCBB_DEL position ever be opened without prior approval from staff.

## Route Validation

!!! warning
    All flights departing out of FCBB must have their route checked and be in compliance with the latest Route Matrix. The Route Matrix below has been provided for easy cross checking of flights.
