# Ground

!!! info
    Brazzaville does not have a dedicated Ground frequency, as such all Ground responsibilities are assumed by Brazzavilla Tower (FCBB_TWR). Under no circumstances should a FCBB_GND position ever be opened without prior approval from staff.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.

On initial call with SMC, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* Persons on Board
* Fuel Endurance
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the SMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active, and if operating on a FPL, a discrete squawk code.

!!! info "VFR Phraseology"
    "ZSCPT, start up approved, Runway XX in use, QNH 1015, report ready for taxi."

## Restrictions

Brazzaville is able to accommodate up to Code F aircraft.
