# Ground
The responsibility of SMC at Dakar-Diass falls to the dedicated Ground ATS unit, "Diass Ground" (GOBD_GND) on 121.800 MHz. SMC will be responsible for the aerodrome movements on the apron. SMC will also be responsible for the initial call of VFR aircraft looking for start and taxi to the runway.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.
On initial call with SMC, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Persons on Board
* Fuel Endurance
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the SMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active runway, and if operating on a FPL, a squawk.

!!! info "VFR Phraseology"
    "ZUPPT, thank you, start up approved, expect Runway 01, QNH 1019, report ready for taxi."

## Pushback/Start up Procedures

All stands at Dakar are nose-in and **pushback is required**, with the exception of the VIP Apron and Apron G.

**An aircraft must be squawking their assigned ASSR code provided in the clearance before push/start clearance is issued. If this is not the case, the SMC controller must instruct the pilot to do so BEFORE any push or start clearance is issued.**

!!! info "Pushback Phraseology"
    "(callsign), push and start approved, facing north, QNH (QNH)."

## Taxi Procedures

For when runway 01 is in use, the SMC controller is recommended to instruct aircraft to hold short of H, so that the tower can sequence aircraft based on preferential departure separation.
For when runway 19 is in use, the SMC controller is recommended to instruct aircraft to contact tower once passing A1, so that the tower controller can sequence aircraft based on preferential departure separation.

!!! info "Taxi Phraseology"
    "(callsign), Taxi and hold short of H via A3 and C."

In high traffic situations, in order to maintain the high speed exits clear of traffic, Tower Controllers may issue an initial taxi instruction to arrival traffic before handover to Ground Controllers.

### Hotspots

!!! warning
   The main apron and surrounding areas may become congested when busy, SMC is encouraged to make a directional entry/exit to the apron, like Nairobi, depending on the active runway."
