# Delivery

Windhoek does not have a dedicated Delivery frequency, as such all Delivery responsibilities are assumed by Windhoek Tower (FYWH_TWR). Under no circumstances should a FYWH_DEL position ever be opened without prior approval from staff.

## Departure Procedures

Pilots shall be issued one of the departures when flying out of Windhoek. This process is done automatically through the vSID plugin on EuroScope.
