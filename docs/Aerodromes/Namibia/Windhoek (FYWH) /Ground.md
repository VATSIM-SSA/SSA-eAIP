# Ground


Windhoek does not have a dedicated Ground frequency, as such all Ground responsibilities are assumed by Windhoek Tower (FIMP_TWR). Under no circumstances should a FYWH_GND position ever be opened without prior approval from staff.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.
On initial call with TWR, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* Persons on Board
* Fuel Endurance
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the TWR controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active Runway and Squawk.

At Windhoek, filing a flight plan is required.

    "VFR Phraseology"

    "ABCDE, thank you, start up approved, expect Runway 08, QNH 1015, Squawk 1234, report ready for taxi."
