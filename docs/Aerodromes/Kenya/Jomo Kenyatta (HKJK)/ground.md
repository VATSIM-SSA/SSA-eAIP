# Ground
The responsibility of SMC at Nairobi falls to the dedicated Ground ATS unit, "Nairobi Apron" (HKJK_GND) on 121.600 MHz. SMC will be responsible for the aerodrome movements on the apron. SMC will also be responsible for the initial call of VFR aircraft looking for start and taxi to the runway.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.
On initial call with SMC, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* Persons on Board
* Fuel Endurance
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the SMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active runway, and if operating on a FPL, a squawk.

!!! info "VFR Phraseology"
    "6YMOO, thank you, start up approved, expect Runway 06, QNH 1019, report ready for taxi."

## Pushback/Start up Procedures

Stands F1 thru F9, J1 thru J9 and 4 thru 21 are nose-in stands and **pushback is required.**

**An aircraft must be squawking their assigned ASSR code provided in the clearance before push/start clearance is issued. If this is not the case, the SMC controller must instruct the pilot to do so BEFORE any push or start clearance is issued.**

!!! info "Pushback Phraseology"
    "(callsign), push and start approved, facing north, QNH (QNH)."

## Taxi Procedures

!!! warning 
   While SMC technically only has jurisdiction up to Taxiway G and A, but for sequencing purposes, SMC is allowed to taxi aircraft onto G and taxi aircraft from the North.

At Nairobi, Apron 1 operates with a one way system in and out, depending on the runway direction.

Runway 06: Taxi out via J, K Taxi in via H, M
![Runway 06 config](apron06.png)

Runway 24: Taxi out via H, M Taxi in via J, K
![Runway 24 config](apron24.png)

By default, all aircraft should be taxiied to the full length holding point unless otherwise requested by a pilot. 
During runway 06 operations, there are two shortcut lanes from G to K that pilots can take. These can be used for sequencing and should be coordinated.
During runway 24 operations, pilots should be asked if they can accept intersection L for departure.

!!! info "Taxi Phraseology"
    "(callsign), taxi to holding point Runway 06 via J and G."

### Hotspots

!!! warning
    During Runway 06 operations, there is an increased chance of conflict with as many aircraft join via G and K.
    Therefore controllers should **exercise extreme caution** and make **extensive** use of the **Red Carpet Rule** and **sequencing knowledge**.
