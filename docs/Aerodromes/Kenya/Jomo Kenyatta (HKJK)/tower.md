# Tower
The responsibility of Tower at Nairobi. falls to the dedicated Tower ATS unit, "Nairobi Tower" (HKJK_TWR) on 118.700. TWR will be responsible for the movements on the runway, as well as the responsibility of ensuring safety amongst VFR aircraft operating in the circuit or within the Nairobi CTR Area III from GND - 9000ft MSL.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft

  * There are no published VFR departure or arrival routings in and out of the Nairobi CTR. Traffic should instead be asked to report either leaving or entering the CTR, or via one of the VRPs.
  * Circuit altitude is 6500ft for propeller-driven aircraft and 7500ft for turbine aircraft. Runway 06 (Left Hand), Runway 24 (Right Hand).

!!! info "Circuit Clearance"
    5YABC, hold position, after departure Runway 06, left hand circuits, not above (6500ft/7500ft), report right downwind Runway 06.

!!! info "Exit Clearance"
    5YABC, hold position, after departure Runway 06, cleared to leave the control zone to the east, not above 9000ft report overhead NDULA marker."

!!!warning "Circuit Width"
    The distance from the downwind leg of the circuit to thr runway at any point should not be less than 1.5 NM in order to avoid overflying the fuel tanks.

!!! note   
    Aircraft which are not affected by wake turbulence, and are operating on a different SID to the leading aircraft infront may be released as soon as the first aircraft is airborne.

## Takeoff Phraseology

!!! info "Takeoff"
    5YABC, wind 080 degrees at 9 knots, cleared for takeoff Runway 06.

## Runway 06 Hotspot
!!! warning
    During runway 06, operations, a hotspot exists at the intersection of taxiways G and K, in which ground conflicts may occur with aircraft from opposite directions approaching taxiway K. In this case, coordinate with ground on whether handoffs will be recieved at G and K intersection (_reccommended for high traffic volume_) or closer to the holding point or in the holding bay (_low traffic_)
