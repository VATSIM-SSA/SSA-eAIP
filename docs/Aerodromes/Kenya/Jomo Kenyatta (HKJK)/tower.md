# Tower
The responsibility of Tower at King Shaka falls to the dedicated Tower ATS unit, "Nairobi Tower" (HKJK_TWR) on 118.700. TWR will be responsible for the movements on the runway, as well as the responsibility of ensuring safety amongst VFR aircraft operating in the circuit or within the Nairobi CTR Area III from GND - 9000ft MSL.

## Takeoff Phraseology

!!! info "Takeoff"
    ZSABC, wind 080 degrees at 9 knots, cleared for takeoff Runway 06.

## Runway 24 Hotspot
!!! warning
    During Runway 24 operations, there is an increased chance of conflict with vacating aircraft at G, and taxiing aircraft to the holding point Runway 24.
    In this case, Tower may issue aircraft instructions to vacate right at the end at Charlie to avoid a potential conflict with prior coordination from Ground.
