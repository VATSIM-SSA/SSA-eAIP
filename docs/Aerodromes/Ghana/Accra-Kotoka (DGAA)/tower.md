# Tower

The responsibility of Tower at Accra Kotoka falls to the dedicated Tower ATS unit, "Accra Tower" (DGAA_TWR) on 118.600. TWR will be responsible for the movements on the runway, as well as the responsibility of ensuring safety amongst VFR aircraft operating in the circuit or within the Accra CTR from GND - 3000ft MSL.

!!! note The Accra CTR airspace is designated as Class D, which means that separation services cannot not provided to VFR traffic.

## Runway Selection
* Since Runway 21 is the only runway with a published precision approach procedure (ILS LOC), it is preferred for operations at the Accra Kotoka airport.
* Runway 03 should only be used if the usage of Runway 21 is with a significant tailwind component (more than 5kts).

## Runway Change Operations

  * Runway changes must be coordinate with existing DEL, GND, TWR, DEP and APP controllers.
  * If possible, hold aircraft on stand before a runway change operation.
  * If an aircraft is already taxying on Twy F, offer the pilot the option to use the existing active Rwy or to enter the runway for taxiway direction change.
  * If an aircraft as already passed an approach IAF fix, an APP or TWR controller should advise the pilot of the possibility of a runway change prior to the aircraft being on the final approach segment.

!!! note   
    Aircraft which are not affected by wake turbulence, and are operating on a different SID to the leading aircraft infront may be released as soon as the first aircraft is airborne.

## Backtracking

If requested by pilots, aircraft are permitted to backtrack to depart Runway 21 at full length. 

!! info "Backtracking Clearance"
    "9GOWU, cleared to enter and backtrack Runway 21, report fully ready."

## Takeoff Phraseology

!!! info "Takeoff (Full Length)"
    "9GOWU, Runway 21 full length, wind 220 degrees at 9 knots, cleared for takeoff."

!!! info "Takeoff (Intersection)"
    "9GOWU, Runway 21 at Intersection A2, wind 220 degrees at 9 knots, cleared for takeoff."

!!! note
    Tower controllers may give the hand off instruction to Accra Approach with the take off clearance.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft

  * There are no published VFR departure or arrival routings in and out of the Accra CTR. Traffic should instead be asked to report either leaving or entering the CTR.
  * Circuit altitude is 1000ft, with circuits conducted away from the terminal. Runway 03 (Right Hand), Runway 21 (Left Hand).
  * Controllers should avoid extending downwinds signicifantly to keep VFR traffic close to the airfield.

!!! info "Circuit Clearance"
    "9GOWU, hold position, after departure Runway 21, left hand circuits, not above 1000ft, report left downwind Runway 21."

!!! info "Exit Clearance"
    "9GOWU, hold position, after departure Runway 03, cleared to leave the control zone to the east, not above 1000ft, report zone outbound."

| 21 | Left  | Up to 1000 AGL | - |
| 03 | Right | Up to 1000 AGL | - |
