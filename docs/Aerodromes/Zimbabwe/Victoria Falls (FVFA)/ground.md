# Ground

Victoria Falls does not have a dedicated Ground frequency, as such all Ground responsibilities are assumed by Falls Approach (FVFA_APP). Under no circumstances should FVFA_GND ever be opened without prior approval from staff.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.

On initial call with SMC, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* Persons on Board
* Fuel Endurance
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the SMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active, and if operating on a FPL, a discrete squawk code.

!!! info "VFR Phraseology"
    "ZSTKD, start up approved, Runway XX in use, QNH 1015, report ready for taxi."

## Restrictions

Victoria Falls is only able to accomodate up to Code E aircraft.

!!! info "VFR Phraseology"

### Arriving Aircraft
Upon arrival into Victoria Falls, inbound aircraft are to provide parking stand (stand number) that they desire. You must check that their requested stand is in compliance with the restrictions listed above. If so, then the aircraft can be instructed to taxi to the bay. If not, ask the pilot for a different stand, or feel free to assign one yourself.

    ETH823: "ETH823, we are looking for Stand XX."

!!! info "Taxiing to the Bay"
    FVFA_APP: "ETH823, taxi via X and X to the bay.
