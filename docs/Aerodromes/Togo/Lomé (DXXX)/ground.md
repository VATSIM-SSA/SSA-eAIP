  * Intersection departures may be assigned using holding points B and M.
  * Aircraft larger than the Boeing 737 are not permitted to make use of holding point M.
  * It can be assumed that all medium and heavy category aircraft require backtrack. 

### Taxi in
  * The Tower controller should give priority to arriving traffic taxiing to their stand before issuing pushback clearances to departing traffic. This is to prevent traffic from blocking arrivals vacating from the runway.

On initial call with Tower, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* Persons on Board
* Fuel Endurance
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the Tower controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active runway, and if operating on a FPL, a squawk.
