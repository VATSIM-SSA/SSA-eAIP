### IFR clearance with non standard departure.

!!! info "Delivery Phraseology"
    "(callsign), cleared to (destination), KETAT2N departure, climb initially (FL), squawk (squawk)."

The runway in use is implied by the SID suffix and is therefore not given with the IFR clearance. 

Non standard departures can also be issued at the discretion of the TMA controller. (DBBB_APP)
