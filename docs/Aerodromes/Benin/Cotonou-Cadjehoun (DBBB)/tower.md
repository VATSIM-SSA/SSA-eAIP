# Tower

The responsibility of Tower at Cotonou falls to the dedicated Tower ATS unit, "Cotonou Tower" (DBBB_TWR) on 118.700. TWR will be responsible for the movements on the runway, as well as the responsibility of ensuring safety amongst VFR aircraft operating in the circuit or within the Cotonou CTR from GND - 1000ft MSL.


## Runway Selection
* Since Runway 24 is the only runway with a published precision approach procedure (ILS LOC), it is preferred for operations at the Accra Kotoka airport.
* Runway 06 should only be used if the usage of Runway 24 is with a significant tailwind component (more than 5kts).

## Runway Change Operations

  * Runway changes must be coordinate with existing TWR and APP controllers.
  * If possible, hold aircraft on stand before a runway change operation.
  * If an aircraft is already taxying on Twy F, offer the pilot the option to use the existing active Rwy or to enter the runway for taxiway direction change.
  * If an aircraft as already passed an approach IAF fix, an APP or TWR controller should advise the pilot of the possibility of a runway change prior to the aircraft being on the final approach segment.

!!! note   
    Aircraft which are not affected by wake turbulence, and are operating on a different SID to the leading aircraft infront may be released as soon as the first aircraft is airborne.

## Backtracking

If requested by pilots, aircraft are permitted to backtrack onto  Runway 06 or 24 at full length. 

!! info "Backtracking Clearance"
    "TYOWU, cleared to enter and backtrack Runway 24, report fully ready."

## Takeoff Phraseology

!!! info "Takeoff (Full Length)"
    "TYOWU, Runway 24 full length, wind 220 degrees at 9 knots, cleared for takeoff."

!!! info "Takeoff (Intersection)"
    "TYOWU, Runway 06 at Intersection B, wind 020 degrees at 9 knots, cleared for takeoff."

!!! note
    Tower controllers may give the hand off instruction to Cotonou Approach with the take off clearance.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft

  * There are no published VFR departure or arrival routings in and out of the Cotonou CTR. Traffic should instead be asked to report either leaving or entering the CTR.
  * Circuit altitude is 1000ft, with circuits conducted away from the terminal. Runway 06 (Left Hand), Runway 24 (Right Hand).
  * Controllers should avoid extending downwinds signicifantly to keep VFR traffic close to the airfield.

!!! info "Circuit Clearance"
    "TYOWU, hold position, after departure Runway 24, right hand circuits, not above 1000ft, report left downwind Runway 24."

!!! info "Exit Clearance"
    "TYOWU, hold position, after departure Runway 06, cleared to leave the control zone to the east, not above 1000ft, report zone outbound."

| Rwy | Turn  | Altitude | Remarks |

| 24 | Right  | Up to 1000 AGL | - |
| 06 | Left | Up to 1000 AGL | - |
