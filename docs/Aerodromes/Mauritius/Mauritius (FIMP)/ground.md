# Ground

!!! info
    Mauritius does not have a dedicated Ground frequency, as such all Ground responsibilities are assumed by Mauritius Tower (FIMP_TWR). Under no circumstances should a FIMP_GND position ever be opened without prior approval from staff.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.
On initial call with SMC, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* Persons on Board
* Fuel Endurance
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the SMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH and Active Runway. **Do not issue a squawk**.

At Mauritius, filing a flight plan is required, even if you do not issue a squawk to the pilot.

!!! info "VFR Phraseology"
    "3NMRU, thank you, start up approved, expect Runway 14, QNH 1015, report ready for taxi."
