# Delivery

!!! info
    Mauritius does not have a dedicated Delivery frequency, as such all Delivery responsibilities are assumed by Mauritius Tower (FIMP_TWR). Under no circumstances should a FIMP_DEL position ever be opened without prior approval from staff.

## Departure Procedures

Pilots shall be issued one of the RNP departures when flying out of Mauritius. This process is done automatically through the vSID plugin on EuroScope.

In the event a pilot is unable to comply, one of the conventional SIDs or other means should be issued to the pilot.
