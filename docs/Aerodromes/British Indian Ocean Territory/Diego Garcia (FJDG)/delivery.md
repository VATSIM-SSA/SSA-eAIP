# Delivery

!!! info
    Diego Garcia does not have a dedicated Delivery frequency, as such all Delivery responsibilities are assumed by Diego Garcia Ground (FJDG_GND). Under no circumstances should a FJDG_DEL position ever be opened without prior approval from staff.

## Departure Procedures

There are no published SID procedures at Diego Garcia. Pilots will be responsible for their own navigation when airborne from Diego Garcia.

## Initial Climb

The Initial Climb provided within the clearance will be set at 17000ft (said as one seven thousand), not FL170.

## Phraseology

Unlike the standard ICAO phraseology, the FAA phraseology follows the "CRAFT" format:

Clearance - Route - Altitude - Frequency - Transponder
