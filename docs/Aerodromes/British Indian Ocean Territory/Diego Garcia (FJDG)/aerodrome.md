!!! failure "Big Warning"
    Alot of the information within this page may not be accurate, as we do not have much information regarding Diego Garcia or its actual workings. And to be honest, we most likely wont because of the nature of NSF Diego Garcia. So alot of information may be missing as such. So please take it with a very big pinch of salt. **And for very big legal reasons, don't use this in the real world either.**

!!! note "FAA"
    As this is primarily used by the US Navy, a lot of procedures and phraseology are FAA, not ICAO like the rest of SSA. We have done our best to try and provide FAA phraseology across the board in this AIP with clearances, etc.
