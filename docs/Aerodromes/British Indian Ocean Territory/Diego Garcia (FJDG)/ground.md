# Ground

## Departures

The North and South ramps will be designaed as non-movement areas, i.e. push and start at own discretion, call for taxi. This can be iterated when the pilot finishes up his readback for clearance.

"AF1, readback correct, push and start your discretion, call ready for taxi onto A"

Once an aircraft is ready to exit the ramp, then clearance to the runway can be issued. Typically, this is all the way to the runway anyway, regardless of other aircraft.

!!! note "Phraseology"
    **AF1, Runway 31, taxi via A, P and H.**


### Follow vs Behind (FAA)

In FAA terms, Follow vs Behind is different compared to ICAO.

When issuing the term "follow", you would not need to repeat any other taxi instructions.

!!! note "Phraseology"
    "AF2, Runway 31, follow the Boeing 747-200 from right to left."
    

If issuing "behind", you will normally still issue a taxi instruction thereafter.

!!! note "Phraseology"
    "AF2, behind the B2 bomber, Runway 13, taxi via P."

## Arrivals

Once an aircraft has vacated, you should ask for the parking that they intend.

!!! note "Phraseology"
    "AF1, say parking."

Once you know the aircraft parking, you can issue them taxi to the ramp.

!!! note "Phraseology"
    "AF1, taxi to the ramp via P and A."
