# Tower
The responsibility of Tower at King Phalo falls to the dedicated Tower ATS unit, "East London Tower" (FAEL_TWR) on 118.300. TWR will be responsible for the movements on the runway, as well as the responsibility of ensuring safety amongst VFR aircraft operating in the circuit or within the King Phalo CTR from GND - 2500ft MSL.

!!! note
    As the frequency for departure is already handed in the IFR clearance, handoffs to the next ATS unit (East London Approach) is not required with departing aircraft.
