# Ground
King Phalo does not have a dedicated Ground frequency, as such all Ground responsibilities are assumed by East London Tower (FAEL_TWR). Under no circumstances should FAEL_GND ever be opened without prior approval from staff.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.

On initial call with SMC, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* Persons on Board
* Fuel Endurance
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the SMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active, and if operating on a FPL, a squawk.
At George, filing a flight plan as VFR is not mandatory unlike Cape Town, so you do not need to ask for a pilot to file a flight plan.

!!! info "VFR Phraseology"
    "ZSTOK, thank you, start up approved, expect Runway 11, QNH XXXX, report ready for taxi."

### Arriving Aircraft

Upon arrival into King Phalo, inbound aircraft are to provide their aircraft registration (tail number) and their parking bay (stand number) that they desire. You must check that their requested stand is in compliance with the restrictions listed above. If so, then the aircraft can be instructed to taxi to the bay. If not, ask the pilot for a different stand, or feel free to assign one yourself.
