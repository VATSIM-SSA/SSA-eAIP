# Ground

The responsibility of SMC at Wonderboom falls to the dedicated Ground ATS unit, Wonderboom Ground (FAWB_GND) on 120.600 MHz. SMC will be responsible for the aerodrome movements outside of the runway, including pushback and taxi to/from the runway. SMC will also be responsible for the initial call of VFR aircraft looking for start and taxi to the runway. 

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.

On initial call with SMC, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* Persons on Board
* Fuel Endurance
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the SMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active, and if operating on a FPL, a discrete squawk code.

!!! info "VFR Phraseology"
    "ZSWBT, start up approved, Runway XX in use, QNH 1015, report ready for taxi."

## Restrictions

!!! warning 
    Aircraft above Code C should be advised that there is no guranteed wingtip clearance provided.

!!! info "VFR Phraseology"
    "SAA875, Confirm you are able to keep clear of the Kenyan E190 ahead of you?"

### Stand Restrictions

| Stands | Restricted To |
| :---------: | :---------: |
| A1 - A2 | Code C (max 36m wingspan) |
| B1 - B4 | Code C (max 36m wingspan) |

### Taxiway and Apron Restrictions

!!! warning 
    Aircraft above Code C should be advised that there is no guranteed wingtip clearance provided.

| Aprons | Restricted to |
| :---------: | :---------: |
| Apron C | Code B (max 24m wingspan) |

## Pushback Procedures

SMC controllers should remain vigilant at all times.

| Runway in use | Direction |
| :---------: | :---------: |
| 11 | NW |
| 29 | NW |
| 24 | NW |
| 06 | SE |


**An aircraft must be squawking their assigned ASSR code provided in the clearance before pushback clearance is issued. If this is not the case, the SMC controller must instruct the pilot to do so BEFORE any push clearance is issued.**

!!! info "Pushback Phraseology"
    "(callsign), push and start approved, face N / S / W / E , QNH (QNH)."

## Taxi Procedures

By default, all aircraft should be taxied to the full length holding point unless otherwise requested by a pilot.

| Runway in use | Intersection | TORA |
| :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |
| 11 | A1 and D1 | 1828 | 
| 29 | B4 | 1828 |
| 24 | B3 | 1267 |
| 06 | F1 | 1267 |

### Hotspots

There are 4 hotspots at FAWB. Pilots should exercise caution. These include B2, B3, F1 and D3.

!!! warning
    All aircraft taxiing to F1 are to exercise extreme caution. They are also to be told to "taxi at own discretion". This is due to the view of taxiway F being 80% obstructed by hangers.

### Arriving Aircraft
Upon arrival into Wonderboom, inbound aircraft are to provide their aircraft registration (tail number) and their parking bay (stand number) that they desire. You must check that their requested stand is in compliance with the restrictions listed above. If so, then the aircraft can be instructed to taxi to the bay. If not, ask the pilot for a different stand, or feel free to assign one yourself.

!!! info "Pilot Reporting Bay Number"
    SAA233: "SAA233, we are ZS-SZF looking for Bay XX."

!!! info "Taxiing to the Bay"
    FAWB_GND: "SAA233, taxi via X and X to the bay.
