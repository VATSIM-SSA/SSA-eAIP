# Ground
The responsibility of SMC at George falls to the dedicated Ground ATS unit, "George Apron" (FAGG_GND) on 122.650 MHz. SMC will be responsible for the aerodrome movements outside of the runway, including pushback and taxi to/from the runway. SMC will also be responsible for the initial call of VFR aircraft looking for start and taxi to the runway.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.

On initial call with SMC, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* Persons on Board
* Fuel Endurance
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the SMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active, and if operating on a FPL, a squawk.
At George, filing a flight plan as VFR is not mandatory unlike Cape Town, so you do not need to ask for a pilot to file a flight plan.

!!! info "VFR Phraseology"
    "ZSTOK, thank you, start up approved, expect Runway 11, QNH 1015, report ready for taxi."

## Pushback Procedures

**An aircraft must be squawking their assigned ASSR code provided in the clearance before pushback clearance is issued. If this is not the case, the SMC controller must instruct the pilot to do so BEFORE any push clearance is issued.**

### Arriving Aircraft

Upon arrival into George, inbound aircraft are to provide their aircraft registration (tail number) and their parking bay (stand number) that they desire. You must check that their requested stand is in compliance with the restrictions listed above. If so, then the aircraft can be instructed to taxi to the bay. If not, ask the pilot for a different stand, or feel free to assign one yourself.

    SAA233: "SAA233, we are ZS-SZF looking for Bay A4."
